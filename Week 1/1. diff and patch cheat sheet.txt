diff and patch Cheat Sheet
diff

diff is used to find differences between two files. On its own, itâ€™s a bit hard to use; instead, use it with diff -u to find lines which differ in two files:
diff -u

diff -u is used to compare two files, line by line, and have the differing lines compared side-by-side in the same output. See below:

******************************************
~$ cat menu1.txt 
Menu1:

Apples
Bananas
Oranges
Pears

~$ cat menu2.txt 
Menu:

Apples
Bananas
Grapes
Strawberries

~$ diff -u menu1.txt menu2.txt

Patch

Patch is useful for applying file differences. See the below example, which compares two files. The comparison is saved as a .diff file, which is then patched to the original file!

~$ cat hello_world.txt 
Hello World
~$ cat hello_world_long.txt 
Hello World

It's a wonderful day!
